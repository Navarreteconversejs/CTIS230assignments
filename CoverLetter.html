    <br>Dear Ms. Latimore:</br>
    <p>I am writing to express my interest in becoming a police officer for the New Orleans Police Department. I am a student at Guilford College in Greensboro, NC and will be completing my <strong>Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice and Psychology</strong> in May of 2021. I have had a strong interest in becoming a police officer prior to pursuing this degree. This organization’s commitment to making the lives of the city’s population as safe as possible coincides with my passion to <strong>protect and serve</strong> the community. My relevant coursework in psychology and criminal justice has helped me understand the complicated subjects of the justice system and human behavior.</p>
    <p>In “Law Enforcement & Police Roles” taught by Professor Will Pizio, I collaborated with a group of peers to present one of the chapters in the textbook on the <strong>Use of Force</strong>. I was also instructed on the many benefits of <strong>community policing</strong> as compared to broken windows policing. Not only was I taught what was in the book, but we were made to get a realistic experience of what being a police officer was like by going on a ride along and interviewing the officer. My experience on the ride along served to reinforce my goal of becoming a police officer. I got to see firsthand the reality of the job and got to hear directly from the source how it is filled with long stretches of monotony and short bursts of uncertainty. However, I was also told that it was <strong>rewarding</strong> for those who truly have a passion for helping those in need.</p>
    <p>In “Developmental Psychology” taught by Professor Larry Eisenberg, I volunteered at Reading Connections, which is an organization that helps improve both children and parents’ ability to read in English. While I was volunteering, I was not only observing the <strong>mental development</strong> of the children I was assisting, but I was also interacting with people of many different communities. I made connections with immigrants who couldn’t speak English, as well as with children who didn’t have the confidence in themselves that they needed in order to succeed. I was forced to <strong>develop more patience, become more in touch with my empathy, and learn how to communicate in more than just a spoken language</strong>.</p>
    <p>It would be a privilege to become a police officer for the New Orleans Police Department. Thank you for your time and consideration and I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
