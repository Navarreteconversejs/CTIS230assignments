    <h1>Initial Perception Paper</h1>
    <div class="information">
    <p class="intro"><strong>Deviance</strong> to me would be defined as straying from a path that is deemed as acceptable by the people one is surrounded by. I try to think about it this way because I am aware that deviance can be <strong>contextual</strong>. Meaning, depending on what society one is a part of, the idea of deviance will vary. An example would be the idea that in Western culture, the older one gets, the less acceptable it is to be living with one’s parents. However, in Eastern countries such as China, it is normal to almost never leave the home of your parents. Sometimes, multiple generations will live in the same house.</p>
    <p id="firsttest">I think that deviance is <strong>unavoidable</strong> by some people, but I also feel that <strong>sometimes deviance is just something that people do just because they want to be different</strong>. Elaborating on the people who can’t avoid being deviant, they could be homosexual in a heterosexual family. They can’t help who or what they are, yet this could be considered deviant as <strong>it may not be considered normal in that particular setting</strong>. As for the people who do deviant things just to be different, examples range from dying one’s hair purple and styling it into a mohawk, to dressing up in an animal costume and going to a convention where others are doing the same thing. <strong>I also feel that unless the deviance is morally wrong or illegal, it shouldn’t really matter</strong>. Like the example of someone dressing up in an animal costume. It’s not illegal and they’re not hurting anyone with what they enjoy doing. However, deviance like being a pedophile is illegal, and is <strong>morally outrageous</strong>.</p>
    <p id="buttontest">As for the source of my views, I’m sure that they have been influenced by people like my mother who raised me. My mother was deviant in her own way but never in ways that hurt anyone. She had me at 18 years old without being married to my father. <strong>This is not illegal, but it is deviant</strong>. She’s always been different than everyone else I know and not just because she’s my mother. She’s never really fit in well with other people and neither have I. I can see how that could be an <strong>influence on my views</strong> of what deviance is and how I feel about it. My idea of what is deviant may have also been influenced by the media or movies. Getting drunk seems to be a normal thing to do when you look at TV and social media, but for me, getting drunk or drinking has never been normal.</p>

    <p id="secondtest" class="conclusion">Understanding why people are deviant and understanding how we determine what is deviant can help me in my future job as a police officer. Being able to see things from <strong>different perspectives</strong> is a very useful skill for a police officer or detective. If I want to be a part of the justice system, I must understand how deviance can lead to changes in policy as well. Learning all areas of the <strong>justice system</strong> is important to me if I want to be successful in what I do.</p>
